# Cybertracks
In the late '80s, the electronic music scene was forever changed by the conception of music trackers on the Amiga. They presented a unique way of creating electronic music on home computers. While largely forgotten these days, I wanted to honor the specific workflow of trackers in this project.

## What is it?
